INITIAL.md for Multi-Agent Voice AI Team Project

Based on the context engineering principles from Cole Medin's framework[1], here's a comprehensive INITIAL.md file for your multi-agent voice AI team project:

## FEATURE:

Build a **scalable multi-agent voice AI team platform** that replaces Vapi with a low-cost, open-source solution capable of serving thousands of concurrent users. The system should enable users to interact via voice with a team of AI agents, each having unique personalities, voices, expertise, and roles, orchestrated by a team lead agent.

### Core Requirements:

**Voice Communication System:**
- Real-time voice interaction with natural conversation flow
- Support for user interruptions and barge-in capabilities
- Custom voice cloning for each agent character using user-provided samples
- Multimodal support (voice, text, image, video input/output)
- Low-latency streaming for responsive interactions

**Multi-Agent Architecture:**
- Orchestrator team lead that routes conversations and coordinates agents
- Specialized agent roles: 
    - The Empath: Healing emotional wounds with warmth and understanding.
    - The Investigator: Uncovering hidden truths and weaving facts into your narrative.
    - The Sage: Revealing cultural wisdom and family heritage.
The Warrior: Forging resilience through stories of courage and leadership.
    - The Visionary: Painting your future dreams and purpose.
    - The Elder: Weaving generational blessings and timeless wisdom.
    - The Writer: synthesizing complex emotional, factual, cultural, and aspirational elements into a unified narrative; making it the perfect complement to the interview team, creating biographies that are both deeply personal and universally meaningful. 
- Each agent has unique personality, expertise (tools), knowledge (RAG database), and voice
- Support for 1-to-1 and 1-to-many agent conversations in the same session

**Agent Management:**
- User-friendly interface for creating and editing agent characters
- Visual character builder with personality customization
- Dynamic agent appearance (static images to dynamic avatars)
- Agent-specific knowledge bases and tool access

**Workflow System:**
- Visual workflow designer for creating multi-agent processes
- Conditional logic and parallel processing capabilities
- Template library for common business workflows
- Real-time workflow execution monitoring

**Session Management:**
- Persistent conversation history across sessions
- Intelligent summarization of interactions
- Automatic extraction of action items and todos
- Searchable conversation archives
- Progress tracking and milestone management

**Scalability & Deployment:**
- Containerized microservices architecture
- Horizontal scaling to support thousands of concurrent users
- Web and mobile app compatibility
- Cloud deployment with auto-scaling capabilities

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

**Performance and Latency:**
- Target <200ms end-to-end voice response time for natural conversation flow
- Implement connection pooling and model caching for high-concurrency scenarios
- Use GPU acceleration for voice processing and LLM inference
- Consider edge deployment for ultra-low latency in key markets

**Voice Quality and Naturalness:**
- Implement emotion detection and contextual voice modulation
- Handle background noise and poor audio quality gracefully
- Support multiple languages and accents for global deployment
- Ensure voice cloning quality matches or exceeds commercial solutions

**Security and Privacy:**
- Implement end-to-end encryption for all voice communications
- Secure storage of user voice samples with proper consent management
- GDPR compliance for EU users, including right to deletion
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention for API endpoints

**Migration Strategy:**
- Design abstraction layers for easy migration from Pipecat to Google ADK
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout of new capabilities
- Maintain backward compatibility during framework transitions
- Document migration paths and breaking changes

**Cost Optimization:**
- Implement intelligent model routing (local vs. cloud based on load)
- Use smaller, specialized models where possible to reduce compute costs
- Implement request batching and caching strategies
- Monitor and optimize token usage across all LLM interactions

**User Experience:**
- Provide clear visual indicators of which agent is speaking
- Implement graceful error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Support both technical and non-technical users with appropriate interfaces
- Include comprehensive onboarding and tutorial systems

**Scalability Bottlenecks:**
- Plan for database scaling with conversation history growth
- Implement efficient session management for thousands of concurrent users
- Design for horizontal scaling of voice processing components
- Consider CDN integration for global voice streaming performance

**Integration Requirements:**
- REST API for third-party integrations
